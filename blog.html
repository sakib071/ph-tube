                    Discuss the scope of 'var', 'let', and 'const'
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Three options are available in JavaScript when creating variables: var, let, and const. The scope
                        of a variable is determined by each of these choices, and that is what we mean by the word
                        'scope'. Let's now discuss scope. Where a variable can be used or accessed within the program is
                        indicated by its scope. It's similar to knowing where in your home a particular item can be
                        used. You can use a fork in the kitchen but not in the bedroom, for instance.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. 'var' Scope</strong>
                        <br>
                        'var' is a keyword in programming that is used to declare variables. A variable functions as a
                        sort of container for the data or information that a computer program needs. Consider it as a
                        container in which you can store stuff.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. 'let' & 'const' Scope:</strong>
                        <br>
                        'let' and 'const' function like variables with boundaries. They are limited to moving around in
                        the code block where they were initially formed. These variables only affect the smaller
                        sections of your code, such as a block surrounded by curly braces, and have what is known as
                        'block scope', which limits their use. While 'const' cannot change its value, 'let' can.
                        Consider 'let' to be a variable that can alter its attire (value) within its block, whereas
                        'const' is like a variable wearing a fixed wardrobe that cannot be changed.

                    Tell us the use cases of 'null' and 'undefined'
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>In JavaScript, the special values 'null' and 'undefined' both denote the absence of a meaningful
                        value. Although they share some similarities, they are applied in slightly different situations.
                        'null' and 'undefined' have the following use cases:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. 'null' Use Cases:</strong>
                        <br>
                        - You can use 'null' to expressively state
                        that a variable or object attribute has no value or is purposefully empty.
                        <br>
                        - You could occasionally use 'null' as a stand-in until a value is set to it
                        or becomes available.
                        <br>
                        - You can check whether a variable has a value by using the word
                        'null'. 'null' is only equal to 'null' or 'undefined' when compared with '==' (loose equality),
                        which can be helpful for determining whether a variable has been initialized.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. 'undefined' Use Cases:</strong>
                        <br>
                        - Implicit Absence: Variables that are declared but not given
                        a value typically have the value 'undefined'. This shows that the variable is present but
                        undefined.
                        - Function Parameters: Extra parameters will have the value 'undefined' if a function is
                        invoked with fewer arguments than it defines parameters for.
                        - Access to Property: The outcome will be 'undefined' if you attempt to access an object
                        attribute that doesn't exist.

                    What do you mean by REST API?

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Imagine you're sending a letter to your friend. You put it in an envelope, write their address on
                        it, and drop it in the mailbox. REST API is kind of like that, but for computers to talk to each
                        other over the internet. This is how it goes:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. Envelope:</strong>
                        <br>
                        The information you want to send or receive is held by an API (Application
                        Programming Interface), just like the envelope carries your letter.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. Address:</strong>
                        <br>You include your friend's address in the letter so that the postman knows where to deliver
                        it. When using an API, you instruct the computer where to transmit or retrieve the
                        information by using a unique web address (URL).
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">3. Mailbox:</strong>
                        <br> Placing the letter in the mailbox is a request.
                        It's comparable to asking the
                        computer to perform a task for you.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">4. Reply with:</strong>
                        <br>After receiving and reading the letter, your friend might respond in writing.
                        When you ask a computer a question via an API, the machine responds with the data you
                        requested. A REST API functions as a technology that facilitates information sharing between
                        computers. Similar to how you use addresses to mail letters, they utilize addresses (URLs) to
                        send and receive data. It enables the collaboration and information exchange of apps and
                        websites through the internet.
