                    Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Whether a variable is declared using 'var', 'let', or 'const' determines its scope in JavaScript.
                        The scope determines where in your code a variable can be used and accessed. Let's talk about
                        each variable declaration's scope:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. 'var' Scope</strong>
                        <br>
                        Block scope is not available to variables declared with the 'var' keyword, only function or
                        global scope. This means that regardless of block statements like "if," "for," or "while" loops,
                        they are accessible both within the function and globally. They are also susceptible to a
                        compilation process known as "hoisting," which involves moving the variable declaration to the
                        top of its scope. The assignment is still at its original location, nevertheless.

                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. 'let' Scope:</strong>
                        <br>
                        Variables declared with the 'let' keyword have block scope, which means that only
                        the block in which they are defined can access them. In comparison to 'var', it's frequently a
                        more logical and anticipated action. Additionally, unlike 'var' variables, 'let' variables are
                        not elevated to the top of their scope, reducing the chance of confusion.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">3. 'const' Object:</strong>
                        <br>
                        Like 'let', variables declared with 'const' also have block scope. However, they also contain
                        the restriction that once their value has been assigned, it cannot be changed. For creating
                        values that must stay consistent throughout the program, "const" variables are helpful.

                    Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>In JavaScript, the special values "null" and "undefined" both denote the absence of a meaningful
                        value. Although they share some similarities, they are applied in slightly different situations.
                        'null' and 'undefined' have the following use cases:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. 'null' Use Cases:</strong>
                        <br>
                        - Explicitly Indicating Absence: You can use 'null' to expressively state
                        that a variable or object attribute has no value or is purposefully empty.
                        - Empty Placeholder: You could occasionally use "null" as a stand-in until a value is set to it
                        or becomes available.
                        - Comparison to Test for Absence: You can check whether a variable has a value by using the word
                        "null." 'null' is only equal to 'null' or 'undefined' when compared with '==' (loose equality),
                        which can be helpful for determining whether a variable has been initialized.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. 'undefined' Use Cases:</strong>
                        <br>
                        - Implicit Absence: Variables that are declared but not given
                        a value typically have the value "undefined." This shows that the variable is present but
                        undefined.
                        - Function Parameters: Extra parameters will have the value "undefined" if a function is
                        invoked with fewer arguments than it defines parameters for.
                        - Access to Property: The outcome will be 'undefined' if you attempt to access an object
                        attribute that doesn't exist.

                    What do you mean by REST API?

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Imagine you're sending a letter to your friend. You put it in an envelope, write their address on
                        it, and drop it in the mailbox. REST API is kind of like that, but for computers to talk to each
                        other over the internet.
                        <br><br>
                        This is how it goes:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">1. Envelope:</strong>
                        <br>
                        The information you want to send or receive is held by an API (Application
                        Programming Interface), just like the envelope carries your letter.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">2. Address:</strong>
                        <br>You include your friend's address in the letter so that the postman knows where to deliver
                        it. When using an API, you instruct the computer where to transmit or retrieve the
                        information by using a unique web address (URL).
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">3. Mailbox:</strong>
                        <br> Placing the letter in the mailbox is a request.
                        It's comparable to asking the
                        computer to perform a task for you.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong class="text-xl">4. Reply with:</strong>
                        <br>After receiving and reading the letter, your
                        friend might respond in writing.
                        When you ask a computer a question via an API, the machine responds with the data you
                        requested.
                        A REST API functions as a technology that facilitates information sharing between computers.
                        Similar to how you use addresses to mail letters, they utilize addresses (URLs) to send and
                        receive data. It enables the collaboration and information exchange of apps and websites
                        through
                        the internet.
